Improvement upon pixel art maker, using a Studio Ghibli API for film information and photos and a Wallpaper API for Ghibli themed wallpapers.
*jQuerry was used for both the API's, JS DOM is being used in the original pixel maker file. 


How to
-Open the index file with Live server on VSCode or visit seemly-plot.surge.sh (information/wallpaper load times may be slow with this option)

Key Features
-Make your pixel art with Ghibli back-drops
-Includes all information you might want to know about the film
-Change your background to a Ghibli themed wallpaper.

Lessons learned
-CSS can be hard, despite its simplistic nature when revisting old projects and trying to recreate the structure its best to draw out the entire layout in grid, that being said I learned grid is defnietely better used as the shell over flex in most cases and flex can be used on the containers within the grid to make things buttery smooth.

-Some API's are stingy with information, I had to use a proxy server. Sad to say the first one I used died 10 hours later so i'm hoping this replacement lasts.

-jQuerry is very useful I decided to do all of my DOM manipulation with it, it was hard to get used to however once I did I reduced 60 lines of code down to 25. Sad to say it's not as popular as it was.



*To be added in the near future
-more games
-a chat room
-local storage
-custimized audio player
